QuickJSON
=========

A QuickLook plugin to pretty-print (node.js style) JSON.

To install a pre-built version for osx 10.6+,
download and unzip
[QuickJSON.qlgenerator.zip](https://github.com/downloads/johan/QuickJSON/QuickJSON.qlgenerator.zip)
into `/Library/QuickLook/` (to install system-globally),
or into `~/Library/QuickLook/` (to install for yourself only).
You may need to create this directory, if it does not exist.

To get sweet copy/paste functionality while in QuickLook, also run

    defaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool true`

from a Terminal window.
